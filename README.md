### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.

Ever since I joined GitHub **6** years ago, I pushed **335** commits, opened **17** issues, submitted **12** pull requests, received **86** stars across **19** personal projects, and contributed to **14** public repositories.

Here is a list of my **projects** that are worth mentioning:

- [CachyOS](https://github.com/CachyOS): An Arch Linux-based distribution with heavy optimizations and multi-architecture support for an
optimal desktop experience. 
- [JomOS](https://github.com/xeome/JomOS): A meta Linux distribution that allows users to easily mix and match well-tested configurations and
optimizations. 
- [JCC](https://github.com/xeome/jcc): This is a self hosting C compiler I have been writing from scratch. 
- [Zmem](https://github.com/xeome/zmem): A Linux memory monitoring program that displays detailed information about virtual memory.

Linux system engineer obsessed with efficiency and micro optimization. Currently, I'm learning C, Linux, XDP, and go. I'm always looking for ways to make my code and systems run faster and more efficiently.
