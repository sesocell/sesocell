Ever since I joined GitHub **6** years ago, I pushed **456** commits, opened **17** issues, submitted **16** pull requests, received **113** stars across **23** personal projects, and contributed to **16** public repositories.

Here is a list of my **projects** that are worth mentioning:

- [CachyOS](https://github.com/CachyOS): An Arch Linux-based distribution with heavy optimizations and multi-architecture support for an
optimal desktop experience. 
- [riscv-kernel](https://github.com/xeome/riscv-kernel): A RISC-V kernel written in C and assembly. This project aims to implement a bare-metal kernel for the RISC-V ISA from scratch. 
- [JCC](https://github.com/xeome/jcc): This is a self hosting C compiler I have been writing from scratch. 
- [Zmem](https://github.com/xeome/zmem): A Linux memory monitoring program that displays detailed information about virtual memory.

Linux system engineer obsessed with efficiency and micro optimization. Currently, I'm learning C, Linux, XDP, and go. I'm always looking for ways to make my code and systems run faster and more efficiently.
